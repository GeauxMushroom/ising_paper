We would like the thank the referee for a careful review of our manuscript
and we would like to address the issues that were raised. 

Comment:
The authors conclude that "a rigorous data
analysis does not seem to deliver unbiased information", which
suggests that this paper cannot give a conclusion.

Our reply:
As the referee points out, we cannot reach a definite conclusion on
whether there is a phase transition in the spin glass under a small
magnetic field. However, with further analysis of our data, we show that
the skewed distribution of susceptibilities are the reason for the
bad behavior of $R_{12}$, which leads to our new conclusion that
this quantity is dominated by rare events, and thus a huge number of
realizations are required to reach meaningful results.

Comment:
If I was going to try to do a calculation like this one, I
would use h= 0.25, at least, and I would expect to need to get to at
least L= 16 to get a meaningful result. The authors may say that these
parameters cannot be achieved in practice at the present time.
However, I also think that 1000 samples at L= 16 might be adequate, so
maybe it could be done.

Our reply:
The referee suggests that we study 1000 samples at L=16, so
we did simulated 11,200 samples at L=16, and included the results in
the discussion. We divided the samples into 4 groups, each with 2800
samples, and calculated $R_{12}$ for each group. The results for
the five groups are very different from each other, especially at low
temperature. Thus, We showed that due to the nature of the susceptibilities,
a small number of samples such as 1000 is not adequate to give meaningful
results.

We hope that the current version of the paper is found suitable for publication.
