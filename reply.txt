Dear Editor:
We would like to resubmit our revised manuscript “Three-dimensional 
Edwards-Anderson spin glass model in an external field”, which was previously 
submitted to Physical Review E under the number ER11202.

We believe that this work is the first attempt to use the ratio of susceptibilities 
to study the 3D Edwards-Anderson spin glass model in an external field.
This quantity works well in four dimensional Edwards-Anderson spin glass model.

We would like the thank the referee for a careful review of our manuscript.
The first referee recommended the publication of our work. As he points out,
we honestly present our results, which reveal the difficulty with current 
methods and computing capabilities in dealing with this problem. 
The other two referees suggested against the publication of our work, due 
to the lack of a definitive conclusion. We believe that although the
results are not conclusive, they should provide some insight into this problem,
and may be helpful to other people studying this field. 

We would like to address the issues that were raised. 

Comment:
The authors conclude that "a rigorous data
analysis does not seem to deliver unbiased information", which
suggests that this paper cannot give a conclusion.

Our reply:
As the referee points out, we cannot reach a definite conclusion on
whether there is a phase transition in the spin glass under a small
magnetic field. However, with further analysis of our data, we show that
the skewed distribution of susceptibilities are the reason for the
bad behavior of $R_{12}$, which leads to our new conclusion that
this quantity is dominated by rare events, and thus a huge number of
realizations are required to reach meaningful results, which is a challenge
to the computing capability we currently have.

Comment:
If I was going to try to do a calculation like this one, I
would use h= 0.25, at least, and I would expect to need to get to at
least L= 16 to get a meaningful result. The authors may say that these
parameters cannot be achieved in practice at the present time.
However, I also think that 1000 samples at L= 16 might be adequate, so
maybe it could be done.


Our reply:
The referee suggests that we study 1000 samples at L=16, so
we did simulated 11,200 samples at L=16, and included the results in
the discussion. We divided the samples into 4 groups, each with 2800
samples, and calculated $R_{12}$ for each group. The results for
the five groups are very different from each other, especially at low
temperature. Thus, We showed that due to the nature of the susceptibilities,
a small number of samples such as 1000 is not adequate to give meaningful
results.


Summary of changes to the manuscript:
We added figures and discussions for the distribution of susceptibilities
in section III.
We added the results for geometric average in section III.
We adjust the conclusion part to discuss the results we obtained 
	with the distribution and the geometric average.
We added some reference.
We added figure and discussion for a simulation of L=16 with a small 
number of realizations in the appendix.


We hope that the current version of the paper is found suitable for publication.




Best,

Report of the First Referee -- ER11202/Feng
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is another in a long series of papers where people throw very
large computational resources at the spin glass problem and end up
with inconclusive results. This has been going on for decades. I
compliment these authors on being honest about their results and not
trying to present them as more conclusive than they really are.
Unfortunately, some others publishing on this topic are less honest.
For this reason, I think it would be better to publish this paper than
not. We would not want it to appear that you can only publish spin
glass simulations that exaggerate their own significance. But it would
have been better if instead the authors had used those massive
computational efforts for something more productive.

Report of the Second Referee -- ER11202/Feng
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This paper studies a spin-glass transition under the magnetic field,
which is very important to clarify the low-temperature nature of the
spin glasses. The authors performed Monte Carlo simulations using
GPGPU and obtained several results. Some of them are conventionally
investigated quantities such as the spin-glass susceptibility, the
Binder ratio, and the scaled correlation length. In addition, the
authors calculated R_{12} quantity recently proposed. The results are
not consistent regarding the existence of the spin-glass transition:
the conventional quantities suggest no transition but the R_{12}
suggests a transition. The authors conclude that "a rigorous data
analysis does not seem to deliver unbiased information", which
suggests that this paper cannot give a conclusion.

I think that this paper is not suitable for publication.

As the authors wrote in the conclusion, nothing is clarified in this
paper. The numerical method presented in this paper is not good for
the spin-glass problem. This is an only information I received from
this paper, and I believe that it is not meaningful to the readers of
PRE.

Report of the Third Referee -- ER11202/Feng
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, the authors have made a poor choice of input parameters
for their simulation. They use L= 6, 8 and 10, and h= 0.10. As is well
known, with these small values of L one cannot really tell what is
going on even for zero h. According to Krzakala et al. in authors'
ref. 59, h_c= 0.65 at T= 0. Thus h= 0.10 is a very small field. For
such a small field at the small values of L used here, one has no
possibility of having reached a putative finite-h scaling regime.

In my opinion, nothing new is learned from the work presented in this
manuscript. If I was going to try to do a calculation like this one, I
would use h= 0.25, at least, and I would expect to need to get to at
least L= 16 to get a meaningful result. The authors may say that these
parameters cannot be achieved in practice at the present time.
However, I also think that 1000 samples at L= 16 might be adequate, so
maybe it could be done.

In my opinion, this manuscript is not suitable for publication in the
Physical Review.
